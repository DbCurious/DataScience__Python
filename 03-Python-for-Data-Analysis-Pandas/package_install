Pandas is built on top of the NumPy package, meaning a lot of the structure of NumPy is used or replicated in Pandas. 
Data in pandas is often used to feed statistical analysis in SciPy, plotting functions from Matplotlib, and machine learning algorithms in Scikit-learn.
Jupyter Notebooks offer a good environment for using pandas to do data exploration and modeling, but pandas can also be used in text editors just as easily.
Jupyter Notebooks give us the ability to execute code in a particular cell as opposed to running the entire file. This saves a lot of time when working with large datasets and complex transformations. 
Notebooks also provide an easy way to visualize pandasâ€™ DataFrames and plots.

Pandas is an easy package to install. 
    conda install pandas or
    pip install pandas
    
To import pandas we usually import it with a shorter name since it's used so much:
    import pandas as pd
